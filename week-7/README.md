This week, we will explore image classification using deep learning models. First, we will examine how to represent images for these models. Next, we will utilize simple artificial neural networks (ANNs) to classify grayscale images. We will also apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify RGB images, visualizing their components for better understanding. To enhance performance, we will discuss data augmentation techniques and, finally, apply transfer learning as a powerful method to leverage pre-trained models. Feel free to experiment with the models.
