This week, we introduce the fundamentals of machine learning, focusing on supervised models. Rather than relying on pre-built libraries like Scikit-learn, we will construct key components of machine learning models from scratch. This hands-on approach will deepen your understanding of how these models function.
The content is tailored for the Principles and Design of IoT Systems module, with IoT-focused use cases, as this is the first week we dive into machine learning and computer vision.

Feel free to explore and modify the code for a more in-depth learning experience!
