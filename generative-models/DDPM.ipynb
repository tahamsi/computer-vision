These models generate data by reversing a diffusion process that incrementally adds noise to the data. By learning to reverse this noising process, DDPMs can produce high-quality samples from complex data distributions."

        "Next, we define the attention module, which the DDPM authors added in between the convolutional blocks. Attention is the building block of the famous Transformer architecture ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)), which has shown great success in various domains of AI, from NLP and vision to [protein folding](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology). Phil Wang employs 2 variants of attention: one is regular multi-head self-attention (as used in the Transformer), the other one is a [linear attention variant](https://github.com/lucidrains/linear-attention-transformer) ([Shen et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01243)), whose time- and memory requirements scale linear in the sequence length, as opposed to quadratic for regular attention.\n",
