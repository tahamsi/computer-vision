This week, we will review and discuss object detection in computer vision. We will explore Ultralytics YOLO11, using it as a prebuilt model and training it on a custom dataset while annotating a dataset of our choice. Additionally, we will delve into MTCNN for face detection and DeepFace for face recognition. I am confident that you will enjoy learning these highly practical methods.

Feel free to experiment with
