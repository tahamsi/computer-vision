This week, we will review and explore image and video segmentation techniques, focusing on models like SAM and SAM 2, along with instance segmentation using the YOLO11 segmentation model. Weâ€™ll also train a YOLO11 model on a custom dataset. Additionally, we will introduce foundation models by discussing CLIP, noting that SAM itself is a foundation model.

Feel free to experiment with the models.
